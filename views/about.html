                In 1991, while a computer science student at the University of
                Helsinki (M.S., 1996), he purchased his first personal computer
                (PC). He was not satisfied, however, with the computer‚Äôs
                operating system (OS). His PC used MS-DOS (the disk operating
                system from Microsoft Corp.), but Torvalds preferred the UNIX
                operating system he had used on the university‚Äôs computers. He
                decided to create his own PC-based version of UNIX. Months of
                determined programming work yielded the beginnings of an
                operating system known as Linux. In 1991 he posted a message on
                the Internet to alert other PC users to his new system, made the
                software available for free downloading, and, as was a common
                practice among software developers at the time, he released the
                source code, which meant that anyone with knowledge of computer
                programming could modify Linux to suit their own purposes.
                Because of their access to the source code, many programmers
                helped Torvalds retool and refine the software, and by 1994
                Linux kernel (original code) version 1.0 was released.

                In a talk held on Summer 2012 at Aalto University in Helsinki
                Finland, Linus Torvalds addressed a question from one of the
                audience members regarding issues they had with a laptop running
                NVIDIA Optimus graphics and the lack of support for Linux.
                Linus' answer was in a form of a rant which in no way can be
                described better with words, than with
                <a

                Since that moment Linus has immediately became even more widely
                known and popular, but as a meme template.

                These days Linus is not that media active anymore, at least,
                when compared to the years behind. He still frequently gives
                public speeches, and addresses people interested on numerous
                programming conferences, particularly those devoted to the
                Linux, though nowadays Linux owes less than 10% of it's source
                code to the Linus' genius.
